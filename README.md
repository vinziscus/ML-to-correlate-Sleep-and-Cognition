# ML-to-correlate-Sleep-and-Cognition
Training a Neural Network to predict study effectiveness based on sleep quality &amp; duration

Problem:
- studies show that more sleep improves study efficiency
- there has to exist an optimum where less sleep decreases efficiency, but the gain in hours worked improves effectiveness overall
- training a Neural Network to predict the optimum of this equation
